#while loop: runs based on a condition. The loop does  not end, until a set condition resolves to false

#while condition:
    # run the code indented in the while block

#One of the common ways to stop a while loop is the use of a flag

#while  5 == 5:
#    print("5 is equal to 5")       
    
count = 1

while count <= 10:
    print (count)
    count = count + 1


print("I'm outside the while loop")

#TO DO:use break statement
